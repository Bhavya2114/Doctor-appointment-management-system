✅ Question 1
👉 If AdminContextProvider updates its state, which components re-render?

“When AdminContextProvider updates its state, only components that consume AdminContext will re-render. Nested providers like DoctorContextProvider will not re-render unless they also depend on AdminContext or receive new props.”


✅ Question 2
👉 Why didn’t we put BrowserRouter inside App.jsx?

🔎 Correct Answer

We put BrowserRouter at the top level (main.jsx) because:
Routing should wrap the entire app
All components — including providers — may need routing access
It separates bootstrapping from application logic


“BrowserRouter is placed at the root in main.jsx because routing is a foundational concern of the application. It ensures the entire component tree has access to routing context and keeps bootstrapping concerns separate from application logic.”


✅ 👉 Question 3

If AdminContextProvider re-renders, will <App /> re-render?

“Yes, <App /> will re-render if AdminContextProvider’s state changes and the context value updates, because App consumes that context. React re-renders components that subscribe to updated context values.”
